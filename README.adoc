= Advertisement Metrics and Recommendations

== Overview

This project processes advertisement impression and click data to generate metrics and recommendations. It uses Spring Boot with a reactive approach and MongoDB to store and process the data.

== Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.x
- Docker (for MongoDB)
- MongoDB 8.x (managed via Docker)

== Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/example/advertisement/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/main/resources/`: Contains configuration files and resources.
- `src/main/resources/application.properties`: Spring Boot configuration file.
- `run.sh`: Shell script to run MongoDB in Docker and execute the application.
- `pom.xml`: Maven build configuration file.

== Running the Application

1. **Start MongoDB using Docker**

   Run the following command to start MongoDB:

    ./run.sh


This script will:
- Start MongoDB in a Docker container.
- Build the Maven project.
- Run the application.

2. **Load Data**

Use the following command to load impression and click data:

  shell> load <impressionFilePathPattern> <clickFilePathPattern>

Replace `<impressionFilePathPattern>` with the path pattern for the impressions JSON files and `<clickFilePathPattern>` with the path pattern for the clicks JSON files. You can specify multiple files by using these path patterns. For example, replace `/x/y/z/click*.json` with the desired pattern for your click JSON files, and `/x/y/z/impression*.json` with the corresponding pattern for your impression JSON files. This allows you to load all relevant files that match the specified patterns at once.

3. **Calculate Metrics**

Use the following command to calculate metrics and save them to a JSON file:

  shell> metrics <metricsOutputPath>


Replace `<metricsOutputPath>` with the path where you want to save the metrics JSON file.

4. **Generate Recommendations**

Use the following command to generate recommendations and save them to a JSON file:

  shell> recommendations <recommendationsOutputPath> <numberAdvertisers>


Replace `<recommendationsOutputPath>` with the path where you want to save the recommendations JSON file and `<numberAdvertisers>` with the number of top advertisers to recommend.

== JSON Schema

*Impression Event Schema*

{
"id": "string",
"app_id": "integer",
"country_code": "string",
"advertiser_id": "integer"
}

Click Event Schema

{
  "impression_id": "string",
  "revenue": "double"
}

Metrics Output Schema

[
  {
    "app_id": 1,
    "country_code": "US",
    "impressions": 102,
    "clicks": 12,
    "revenue": 10.2
  }
]

Recommendations Output Schema

[
  {
    "app_id": 1,
    "country_code": "US",
    "recommended_advertiser_ids": [32, 12, 45, 4, 1]
  }
]


== Future Work

Error Handling: Improve error handling for file parsing and data processing.
Performance Optimization: Analyze and optimize the performance of data processing pipelines.
Schema Validation: Add schema validation for incoming JSON files to ensure data quality.
